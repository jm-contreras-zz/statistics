statistics
==========
**Repository of MATLAB scripts that I wrote as a graduate student (2011-2013) to assist with statistical analysis.**



- ***anova_rm_multi.m*** performs a one- or two-way [analysis of variance (ANOVA)](#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance) as a wrapper to two scripts that are not mine, *anova_rm.m* and *rm_anova2.m*.

- ***chi2gof_ed.m*** generates a variable's expected distribution and performs a [chi-square goodness-of-fit test](#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test) as a wrapper to a native MATLAB function.

- ***dissimilar.m*** creates a [dissimilarity matrix](#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_matrix) from a vector.

- ***pairwiseT.m*** performs every possible pairwise [t-test](#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test) (paired or independent) between the columns of a matrix.

- ***sem.m*** computes the [standard error of the mean](#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error).

- ***wsci.m*** calculates within-subjects confidence intervals as described by [Masson and Loftus (2003)](#http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19485604).

- ***wscohensd.m*** computes [Cohen's d](#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen.27s_d) for within-subjects data.
