statistics
==========
**Repository of MATLAB scripts that I wrote as a graduate student (2011-2013) to assist with statistical analysis.**



***anova_rm_multi.m*** performs one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) as a wrapper of two scripts that are not mine, *anova_rm.m* and *rm_anova2.m*.

***chi2gof_ed.m*** generates a variable's expected distribution and performs a chi-square goodness-of-fit test as a wrapper to a native MATLAB function.

***dissimilar.m*** creates a dissimilarity matrix from a vector.

***pairwiseT.m*** performs every possible pairwise t-test (paired or independent) between the columns of a matrix.

***sem.m*** computes the standard error of the mean.

***wsci.m*** computes within-subjects confidence intervals as described by Masson and Loftus (2003).

***wscohensd.m*** computes Cohen's d for within-subjects data.
