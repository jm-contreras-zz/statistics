statistics
==========
Repository of MATLAB scripts that I wrote as a graduate student (2011-2013) to assist with statistical analysis.



- ***anova_rm_multi.m*** performs a one- or two-way [analysis of variance (ANOVA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance) as a wrapper to two scripts that are not mine, *anova_rm.m* and *rm_anova2.m*, but are included for convenience.

- ***chi2gof_ed.m*** generates a variable's expected distribution and performs a [chi-square goodness-of-fit test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test) as a wrapper to a native MATLAB function.

- ***dissimilar.m*** creates a [dissimilarity matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_matrix) from a vector.

- ***pairwiseT.m*** performs every possible pairwise [t-test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test) (paired or independent) between the columns of a matrix.

- ***sem.m*** computes the [standard error of the mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error).

- ***ws_conf_int.m*** calculates within-subjects confidence intervals as described by [Masson and Loftus (2003)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19485604).

- ***ws_cohensD.m*** computes [Cohen's d](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen.27s_d) for within-subjects data.

- ***ws_lin_con.m*** uses contrast weights to test a within-subjects [linear contrast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_%28statistics%29) as described by [Keppel and Wickens (2004)](http://books.google.com/books/about/Design_and_Analysis.html?id=SOckAQAAIAAJ).
